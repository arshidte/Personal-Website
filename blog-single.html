                In 1991, the first ever website went live which was some texts only. It took a couple of years to see a video went live
                on another website. It was in 2005. Now, today, we have a bunch of youtubers making videos daily in almost all topics.
                Such jumps are unpredictable and spontaneous. Today, we are in the middle of such a jump. It is called Metaverse. It will
                change how things work today. Ever since Mark Zuckerburg announced metaverse, critics all around the globe says that
                metaverse is dystopian and poses terrible danger to humanity. They are saying that the customer will become a puppet 
                and Zuckerberg will control everything. Is that real? I think not.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am talking today about what is happening and how you can profit from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have seen Ariana Grande's latest concert which was completely inside a game. Can you even imagine that just a 
                couple of years ago?No, right? It made a unique experience and completely new level of interaction. What this type of 
                experience does is connecting something from the real world with something from the virtual world. So, it is clear that 
                something very interesting is happening right now. What is more exciting is that the change is happening in all industries.
                BMW announced their new car through rocket league game. Streaming companies like Netflix is making video games. This is 
                going to change how we interact with both real and virtual world. So waht exactly is the metaverse? Metaverse is the 
                combination of web 3.0, virtual reality and blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Web 3.0 - This is the next version of the internet. Yes, there are more versions of the internet. Web 1.0, as we said, was 
                just a page with some links to other pages which also contains only text.There was no images, videos or interactions.
                Then, the web 2.0 came which is the current one. It is largely community based adn highly interactive. Most of it is user
                generated content. But, what we can own on internet is just domain name. Everything else is owned by corporations.
              </p>
              <p>
                This leads us to web 3.0. Simply saying, in web 3.0 we can own parts of the internet. Everything that you make, buy or sell 
                on the internet is yours and you have the full rights. This happens because of blockchain. Specifically, NFTs. NFT means 
                non fungable tockens. It is like a piece of art which cannot be replaced. You may be thinking, NFTs are some useless pixels 
                on a screen. But people are paying millions of dollars for it. Eg:- A guy name Metakovan in our country payed $69M Dollars. For 
                an NFT art. But you may think, anyone can right click on the picture and just save to your laptop. How is that so valuable?
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's talk about real money. It's just a piece of paper, right? But people are trading goods for the same. Well, it's because 
                over the years we agreed that a 100 rupee note is worth a hundred and we trust that. Just like this, there are people who values 
                the NFTs abd believes in it adn it provides ownership because it can be tracked in the blockchain and cannot be copied. We are 
                failing to see what NFTs can become in the future the same way websites transform over time. So, you have this way of truly owning 
                something and using it in the context of web 3.0.

              <p>
                Now, virtual reality. It is the coolest thing of now. If someone says facebook is building the metaverse, it is fundamentally wrong.
                Because, they don't own the internet or blockchain or VR. Once blockchain becomes mainstream, the internet is owned by individuals.
                For eg:- Imagine you are an artist and you make one song and sell it for 100 rupees as an NFT. In your smart contract, you add that 
                every time your song gets sold, you can earn a commission. So, not only you make money, your community also makes money from your work 
                and this is how individual ownership is happening. That is what the metaverse really is. 'Rise of individual ownership'
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, how can we make profits from it? We are in the super early days of this. People are just starting to get educated in this 
                space. There is a lot of room for growth adn a whole new pie to eat from. If you still consider this as dystopian, you will be left 
                behind in near future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, let me say something exciting. You can buy digital land in video games. Imagine being a digital real estate investor in the
                 next 10 years!!!
