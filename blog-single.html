                In 1991, the first-ever website went live, consisting of text-only content. It took a couple of years until the first video was uploaded to another website in 2005. Today, we have a multitude of YouTubers creating videos daily on a wide range of topics. These technological advancements and shifts have often been unpredictable and spontaneous. One such current transformation is the emergence of the metaverse, which is believed to change how things operate today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since Mark Zuckerberg announced the metaverse, critics worldwide have expressed concerns about its potential dystopian nature and the perceived danger it poses to humanity. Some argue that customers will become mere puppets, with Zuckerberg controlling everything. However, it is important to examine these claims critically and consider the broader implications.

                Web 3.0 - This is the next version of the internet. Yes, there are more versions of the internet. Web 1.0, as we said, was 
                just a page with some links to other pages which also contains only text.There was no images, videos or interactions.
                Then, the web 2.0 came which is the current one. It is largely community based adn highly interactive. Most of it is user
                generated content. But, what we can own on internet is just domain name. Everything else is owned by corporations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The metaverse represents a significant development in which real-world experiences are connected with virtual elements. For instance, the recent concert by Ariana Grande, which took place entirely inside a game, demonstrated a unique level of interaction and a new kind of experience. This type of integration between the real and virtual worlds is becoming increasingly prevalent, and its impact extends to various industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, BMW announced its new car through the game Rocket League, while streaming companies like Netflix are venturing into video game production. These shifts will revolutionize how we interact with both the real and virtual realms. But what exactly is the metaverse? It is the convergence of Web 3.0, virtual reality (VR), and blockchain technology.

                Web 3.0 represents the next iteration of the internet. The internet has undergone various versions, with Web 1.0 consisting of basic text pages and Web 2.0 is the current iteration characterized by community-based interactions and user-generated content. However, in Web 2.0, individuals can only own domain names, while everything else is owned by corporations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Web 3.0, on the other hand, empowers users to own parts of the internet. Through blockchain technology, particularly non-fungible tokens (NFTs), individuals can assert full ownership rights over what they create, buy, or sell on the Internet. NFTs are akin to unique pieces of art that cannot be replaced. While some may perceive NFTs as mere pixels on a screen, people are paying millions of dollars for them. Just as we assign value to physical money despite it being paper, NFTs derive value from the trust and belief placed in them, along with the immutability and traceability provided by blockchain technology. It is crucial to recognize the potential of NFTs and how they can evolve over time, similar to the transformation of websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving on to virtual reality, it is a fascinating technology that is currently at the forefront of innovation. Claiming that Facebook alone is building the metaverse is fundamentally incorrect since they do not own the internet, blockchain, or VR. Once blockchain becomes mainstream, the Internet will be owned by individuals, not centralized entities. As an example, imagine you are an artist who creates a song and sells it as an NFT for 100 rupees. By including a commission clause in the smart contract, you can earn a percentage every time your song is resold. This mechanism enables not only individual profit but also allows your community to benefit from your work, highlighting the rise of individual ownership within the metaverse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, how can we profit from these developments? We are currently in the early stages of this technological revolution, and people are just beginning to educate themselves about this space. There is substantial room for growth, and a whole new market is emerging. If one continues to view this transition as dystopian, they may risk being left behind in the near future.
              </p>
              <p>
                To conclude, it is worth noting an exciting aspect: the ability to purchase digital land within video games. Imagining being a digital real estate investor in the next 10 years is certainly enticing. However, it is important to approach these opportunities with a critical mindset and consider potential risks and challenges along the way.
